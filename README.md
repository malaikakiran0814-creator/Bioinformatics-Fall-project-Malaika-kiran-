We were given an unknown sequence. We did DNA, RNA, and protein analysis by converting the DNA sequence to an amino acid sequence and also checked multiple sequence alignment and interaction of the target protein with others by using different bioinformatic tools. DNA sequence alignment, RNA stable structure, protein secondary structure, domains and properties, phylogenetic tree, and subcellular localization of the protein were recorded.
Based on all these results, we conclude that the unknown sequence was for Taste receptor type 1 member 2 protein (TAS1R2) of the organism Pygathrix nigripes, located on chromosome 17. NCBI BLAST, ORF Finder, ExPASy, UniProt, Vienna RNA Web Server, ClustalW, PFAM, PredictProtein, CELLO, TargetP, STRING, and other tools were used for this analysis.
Thanks to Professor Samina Shakeel for guiding us to complete this project.
